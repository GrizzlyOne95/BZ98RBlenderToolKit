# Battlezone Blender Toolkit

Full import/export suite for Battlezone 1998 Redux and The Red Odyssey.

The Battlezone Blender Toolkit is a Blender add-on for working with classic Battlezone model formats (`.vdf`, `.sdf`, `.geo`, `.map`), Redux model formats (`.mesh`, `.skeleton`, `.material`), ZFS archives, and BZMapIO terrain workflows (`.hg2`).

It combines legacy model editing, Redux mesh export, terrain tools, validation, and workflow helpers into one Blender-based toolset.

## Install

1. Download the newest `bz98tools.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/GrizzlyOne95/BZ98RBlenderToolKit/releases).
2. In Blender, open `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons`.
3. Click `Install...` or `Install From Disk`.
4. Select the downloaded zip.
5. Enable `Battlezone GEO/VDF/SDF Formats`.
6. Restart Blender when replacing an already-loaded version.

## Supported Blender Versions

- Blender 4.5 LTS is the primary target.
- Blender 5.1 is supported for the main import/export workflows.
- The optional native Ogre mesh/skeleton fast path is available on Windows Blender 4.5.x. Blender 5.1 falls back to XML conversion until a Python 3.13 native backend is available.

## Main Features

- Import and export legacy `.geo`, `.vdf`, and `.sdf` files.
- Import models directly from `.zfs` archives with dependency extraction.
- Export Redux `.mesh`, `.skeleton`, and `.material` output.
- Use explicit Legacy Only, Legacy + Redux, and Redux Mesh Only workflows.
- Import/export `.hg2` terrain through integrated BZMapIO map tools.
- Paint stock and custom world terrain atlases.
- Convert `.map` textures to `.png` on import and prepare `.dds` output on export.
- Validate legacy model naming, hierarchy, hardpoints, LODs, pivots, collision helpers, and animation setup.
- Generate cockpit GEOs from selected LOD1 faces.
- Create organic Redux skins from legacy GEO control pivots.
- Use advanced VDF helpers for spinners and raw transform experiments.

## Latest Highlights

- `v1.4.7`: fixed Animation Tools mirror dialog invocation so `Mirror From` and `Mirror To` selectors open from the sidebar.
- `v1.4.6`: fixed popup info buttons such as `What Gets Checked`.
- `v1.4.5`: added custom world atlas terrain painting, compact validation reports, expanded legacy guide validation, and removed unsupported Game Playback tooling.
- `v1.4.4`: added experimental GEO face-plane controls and walker cockpit stabilizer.
