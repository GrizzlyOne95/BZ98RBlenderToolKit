# Experimental Binary Fields Reference

This note documents raw values currently exposed in the toolkit for advanced import/export workflows.

Sources used:
- Commando950 addon docs
- Nielk1 `bz1-geo-editor` (`BZ1GeoEditor/Geo.cs`)
- Battlezone 98 Redux PDB reference in `Battlezone98Redux_Shim`
- Stock Redux assets in `Documents/Battlezone 98 Redux/Edit/stock` (1615 GEO, 98 VDF, 115 SDF scanned)
- Blake "Dummy" Robinson legacy VDF/SDF/GEO viewers and 3D Studio Max import/export plugins

## VDF / SDF ANIM

The PDB names the 64-byte ANIM payload as `tagANIMOBJ_HEADER`:

- `ANIM null2` maps to `animPtr`.
- `ANIM unknown2` maps to `meshPtr`.
- `ANIM reserved[0]` maps to `rotKeyPtr`.
- `ANIM reserved[1]` maps to `sclKeyPtr`.
- `ANIM reserved[2]` maps to `posKeyPtr`.
- `ANIM reserved[3]` maps to `obj`.
- `ANIM reserved[4]` maps to `entity`.

On disk, stock exported assets store these pointer-placeholder fields as zero. The toolkit preserves them for round-trip safety, but modders normally should not edit them.

The PDB names `ANIMElement.unknowngeoflag[32]` as `meshIndex[32]`. Stock files use it as a 0/1 per-mesh-slot mask: `1` means the animation element affects that indexed GEO/mesh slot, `0` means it does not.

The PDB names `ANIMOrientation.unknown` as `tagANIMOBJ_MESH.flags`. Stock files scanned so far store `0`.

`UseTranslation2Track` writes Blender scale keys to the legacy `SCLKEY` slot (`tagANIMOBJ_SCLKEY`). The toolkit still uses the historical internal class name `ANIMTranslation2`, but engine symbols identify this as the scale-key track. A few stock assets use it for special motion.

## VDF SPCS / SCPS

Redux symbols contain an `SPCS` chunk tag and a `VDF_VEHICLE_SHELL_INFO` structure for shell UI slots, while older addon code called the preserved raw block `SCPS`. No stock VDF in the current scan contained this optional block. Treat the toolkit's `SPCS/SCPS Data` fields as compatibility preservation only until a real sample is found.

## VDF / SDF Object Records

The PDB names the VDF object record as `ObjectType` and the SDF object record as `StructObjectType`.

Confirmed names:

- `GEOFlags` is `ObjectFlags`.
- `SDFDDR` is `ddr`.
- The SDFC header field formerly labeled `Defensive` is also a raw integer DDR-style value.
- `SDFX`, `SDFY`, `SDFZ` are the `Target` vector.
- `SDFTime` is `Time`.

Stock scan notes:

- VDF `ObjectFlags` was `0` in all 1243 valid stock VDF object records.
- SDF `ObjectFlags` was `0` in all normal valid structure records seen in the scan.
- Stock SDF `ddr` is commonly `500000`; mine/powerup-like SDFs can use smaller values such as `200`.
- Stock type-15 structure spinner helpers commonly use `Target.y` as a small spin-speed value such as `0.1` or `0.2`.

## GEO Header (`=4si16siii`)

Toolkit fields:
- `GEOHeaderUnknown` = second int in header. This behaves like a legacy checksum/signature field in stock assets; preserve imported values for round-trip compatibility.
- `GEOHeaderUnknown2` = trailing int in header.

Stock scan notes:

- `GEOHeaderUnknown2` was `0` in all 1615 stock Redux GEO files scanned.

From `bz1-geo-editor`, the trailing int is treated as object `Flags` with these common bits:
- `0x001` Gouraud shaded
- `0x002` Tiled bitmap
- `0x004` Texture map
- `0x008` Parallel
- `0x010` True perspective
- `0x020` Wireframe
- `0x040` Transparent pixels
- `0x080` One-third translucent pixels
- `0x100` Project polygon only

## GEO Face (`=iiBBBffffi3s13sii`)

Toolkit per-face attrs (import/export):
- `bz_face_unknown_raw` (reserved int; stock scan found `0` on all faces)
- `bz_face_shade_type` (byte stored in int attr)
- `bz_face_texture_type` (byte stored in int attr)
- `bz_face_xluscent_type` (byte stored in int attr)
- `bz_face_parent` (int)
- `bz_face_node` (int)
- `bz_face_plane_x` (float)
- `bz_face_plane_y` (float)
- `bz_face_plane_z` (float)
- `bz_face_plane_d` (float)

Direct GEO export has an experimental `Face Plane Export` mode:
- `Current Toolkit Default` writes the older toolkit behavior: face center X/Y/Z and `D = 1.0`.
- `Preserve Imported` writes imported `bz_face_plane_x/y/z/d` attributes when present.
- `Recompute From Faces` writes a normalized face plane and distance from the exported GEO-coordinate vertices.
- `DX Normal Distance Fix` currently uses the same recompute path as a best-effort recreation of the old Max GEO exporter workaround. The exact 2010 exporter formula still needs sample comparison or deeper reverse engineering before it should be treated as a byte-identical recreation.

The old Max `GEOExport.dle` exposes a `DX normal distance fix` option. Its help text says the workaround addresses a Battlezone engine issue where triangles can disappear even though they should be visible. Ghidra analysis of that exporter shows it computes per-face plane data while writing faces, which is why the toolkit now preserves and can recompute these fields instead of always discarding them on import.

The unpacked legacy GEO viewer stores each face in a 216-byte in-memory record: 56 bytes for fixed face data plus room for ten 16-byte polygon-vertex records. The on-disk format stores a variable vertex count, but faces over 10 vertices are now flagged by validation because they can overflow or break older tools.

The PDB `FACE` structure confirms the three string-header bytes as:

- `ShadeType`
- `TextureType`
- `XluscentType`

The same structure has an in-memory `front_facet` pointer and `Test_Point`; the on-disk parent/node integers appear to be loader inputs for that face tree rather than arbitrary user data.

Stock scan notes:

- Most faces use bytes `04 01 00` (flat shaded, true perspective, not translucent).
- Gouraud faces use `05 01 00`.
- A small number use `04 03 00` (flat shaded plus true perspective and tiled texture bits).

Face enum values from `bz1-geo-editor`:

Shade type (`bz_face_shade_type`):
- `1` wireframe
- `2` solid wireframe
- `3` constant shaded
- `4` flat shaded
- `5` gouraud shaded

Texture type bits (`bz_face_texture_type`):
- `0x01` true perspective
- `0x02` tiled texturemap
- `0x04` transparent textmap

Xluscent type (`bz_face_xluscent_type`):
- `0` none
- `1` one-third
- `2` two-third

Node/tree branch (`bz_face_node`):
- commonly treated as `0` back, `1` front.

## Legacy VDF/SDF Viewer Rules

The legacy VDF/SDF viewer CHM documents several rules now mirrored in validation/tooltips:

- Type `40` is the POV/eyepoint; vehicles without an exportable POV can crash Battlezone when ejecting.
- Body/root GEOs should resolve to parent `WORLD`.
- VDF children must appear after parents in the object table; the toolkit exporter already orders object records from the Blender hierarchy.
- Common naming suffixes include `bd*` body chunks, `pov`, `gc*` cannon hardpoints, `gr*` rocket hardpoints, `gm*` mortar hardpoints, `gs*` special hardpoints, `tx*` pitch rotators, and `ty*` yaw rotators.

## Safety

- Always keep backups.
- Change one field at a time and test in-game.
- Some values are engine- or asset-specific and may be ignored.
